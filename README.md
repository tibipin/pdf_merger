# PDF-Merger

PDF editer and merger created for Molson Coors GBS based on business requirements.
The tool has a simple GUI where the user can select several folders and import an excel report.
The tool consists of two parts and has two buttons: 
  1. It writes a specific number on the pdfs based on the imported excel files
  2. Merges all the files written in the excel report line by line
